# JS Click and Drag to Scroll

## Description

This exercise consists on working with different mouse events to scroll over a certain group of elements when clicking and dragging over them.

## Javascript Used

* querySelector()
* Element.classList
* Element.scrollLeft
* Element.offsetLeft
* mouse events


## Events

* The `mousedown` event is fired at an `Element` when a pointing device button is pressed while the pointer is inside the element.
* The `mouseUp` event is fired at an `Element` when a button on a pointing device (such as a mouse or a trackpad) is released while the pointer is located inside it.
* The `mouseLeave` event is fired at an `Element` when the cursor of a pointing device (usually a mouse) is moved out of it.
* The `mousemove` event is fired at an element when a pointing device (usually a mouse) is moved while the cursor's hotspot is inside it.
* `onClick` will only trigger when the left mouse button is pressed and released on the same object.
